Contains the progression of my EPQ Checkers program. It operates in the terminal and uses the MiniMax algorithm to decide an "optimal move". 
I accidentally changed the naming convention of my programs half way into development, I have recently renamed them all to share the same convention for convenience, the history of each program shows they were first committed more than a year ago.
